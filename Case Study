Crypto.com: A Case-study. 

Blockchain has been around since the 1990s (quote). However, it was only in the last decade that various start-ups started to take advantage of the advent of this new technology. 
	The first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, paved way to thousands more and people started speculating on the future price of those digital assets. The creation of exchanges, centralized and decentralized allows the purchasing, selling and trading of said tokens. Over the years dozens of exchanges emerged and one of those is the now-popular exchange Crypto.com.
Monaco Technologies GMBH was founded in June of 2016 in Singapore by Kris Maszalek, Bobby Bao, Gary Or, and Rafael Melo (1) while their ICO took place at a later date. 


The mission statement of Crypto.com is to be more than just a digital currency exchange. Monaco Technology aimed at bridging the gap between traditional finance and the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. They want to “accelerate the world’s transition to cryptocurrency”. (2) The original idea behind the launch of Monaco was to create a bank card that enabled people to use it as a traditional bank card while spending their cryptocurrencies. They originally wanted to give more power, more control to the owner 
Crypto.com really started out as a company called Monaco Technology GMBH in 2017 after raising 71,392 ETH or $27 million during its ICO (Initial Coin Offering). (3)(4) The company did not hesitate to announce its own VISA card program that was thought of as a means to allow token holders to buy products with the tokens they have loaded onto their debit cards. 
As Crypto.com’s mission statement quoted they wanted to speed up the adoption of cryptocurrencies with their platform. In 2017 and 2018 blockchain adoption rates were far below today’s levels and there were numerous obstacles users had to overcome in order to interact with the blockchain. 
	The Monaco card was set out to help people spend their crypto assets using a more streamlined and rather familiar way. Teaming up with Visa Monaco was able to put a debit card in the hands of the users who could then use the debit card for everyday purchases. The card worked as a traditional top-off card and had many features known from using tradefi debit and credit cards. 
On the other hand the company’s own mobile wallet put digital banking in the hands of the users. In the United States, for example, it is New York Metropolitan Bank is the official banking partner of Crypto.com. The cards are issued by them, however, users don’t have to interact with the bank at all. Everything is done through the mobile app. Linking the assigned account to other banks through the traditional Swift network, depositing fiat currency to NYMB’s account, and topping off the debit card all done within the app. The card can be frozen, international usage enabled or disabled, pin code changed, all in the app.  
The ease of use of the app and the familiarity of a traditional bank card really allows the quick adoption rate of the card and alas the blockchain itself. 
Not even two years after moving to its own blockchain and issuing the first cards Crypto.com already boasts over 80 million users world wide. While most of the customers are from Asia and the United States, the cards can be obtained in 90 different countries world wide. (5). According to Kris Maszalek the company’s goal is to continue increasing its user-base. By the 2025 they would like to reach 150 million users. (6)
The adoption rates have been certainly boosted by the aggressive marketing that  Crypto.com has been pushing in the last years. One of their most known push to become become subject of locker room (and household) arguments was the deal to become the naming rights sponsor of the former Staples Center in Los Angeles, CA, the home of the Los Angeles Lakers, the Clippers of the NBA, the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA, and the LA Kings of the NHL. (7). The company will pay over $700 million in 20 years making this the biggest naming rights deal in sports history. (8). 
Besides the investment in Los Angeles, Crypto.com was also on the television screen during the month-long 2022 FIFA World Cup that took place in Doha, Qatar, a 10-year and $175 millon deal with the UFC, and a 5-year and $100 million sponsorship deal with the Formula 1. 
This marketing plan undoubtedly put Crypto.com to the forefront of crypto adoption. In recent months, however, the company has been in the center of scrutiny as their television commercials did not age well in the current economic situation. Crypto.com has since taken its advertisement with Matt Damon now referred to as “Fortune Favors the Brave” (9)
Crypto.com’s marketing efforts are only outpaced by its efforts to keep up with the exceedingly fast rate the cryptocurrency market is changing. Their updates page has near-daily announcements about new token listings, system maintenance updates, new features to their mobile wallet, app, and so on. (10)
At the end of 2022 their decentralized (defi) wallet extension on mobile phones introduced a feature that enabled Ledger (11) support. This update gives an extra layer of security by enabling users to interact with the blockchain in a secure way by using their tokens held in cold storage. (12) Tokens held on Ledger or similar drives are offline and require the physical possession of said drive, the knowledge of a pin code, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the tokens. This extra layer of security puts the user’s mind at ease that unless they relinquish their private key by accident the funds will be secure. 
 It is not difficult to see that Crypto.com has been dabbling in multiple areas of fintech domains. These include but are not limited to Personal Finance,  Deposits, Online Banking, Lending, and Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies. 
Personal finance is a domain of fintech that allows the user to put their finances in their own hands. Instead of relying on a middle-man, as in banks, bankers, brokers, financial advisors, people now can access and manage their own investments. Crypto.com does not have a brick and mortar location where customers could go to open an account, deposit, or withdraw money, or even use their money. Instead Crypto.com relies on the user’s ability to use the app and do what in the past required the assistance of someone working for the bank. 
Their own “university” allows the user to learn about cryptocurrency, trends, various terms, and just about anything needed to get a basic idea about this new technology. (13)
	Within the app people can connect their account to a third-party bank by linking a bank account and by using a third-party app called Plaid that allows a secure connection medium between Crypto.com and the third-party bank. Once logged in to the bank and gave authorization money can be instantaneously transferred from the bank to Crypto.com’s banking provider, New York Metropolitan Bank. While the actual transfer between the banks may take days, once the transaction is approved Crypto.com instantly releases the amount to the user so no time is wasted and the funds can be used to buy anything within the app. 
	While using Plaid simplifies the entire process, there are more traditional (and slower) ways to link a bank account, for example ACH transfer, and wire transfer. Both of these will take longer, 3-5 or 1-2 business days, respectively, to process the transfer of the funds. 
	Crypto.com is also part of the online banking domain within financial technology just by virtue of providing its services through its mobile app, desktop, and external wallet only. 
	Lending and borrowing are both available services by Crypto.com for their users. It is not natively available using the app. For this option customers need to use the platform’s exchange that is for now oly available on the desktop version. While certain elements of crypto may make it difficult for rapid adoption of the blockchain technology Crypto.com definitely does an excellent job at ensuring that the steps needed for borrowing are not complicated and even demonstrated  visually on their own YouTube page. (14) In that example users are shown how to borrow Tether stablecoin (USDT) against Bitcoin as collateral. 
	It requires no explanation how Crypto.com fits into the blockchain and cryptocurrency domains of fintech. 
	Crypto.com is arguably one of the biggest names on the blockchain when it comes to product development and adoption. The crypto space is ever-evolving and technologies that did not even exist 5 let alone 10 years ago have become commonplace. A decade ago bitcoin stood as the only cryptocurrency and was not really known. Fast forward to 2023 and people have bought, sold, praised and wrote off bitcoin and the currently one trillion dollar total valuation of the crypto currency market. While Crypto.com’s share is only a sliver, their addition to the total crypto space contributed to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.    
	Just like in any other field one company cannot stand by itself and be the only service provider. Crypto.com, too, has many competitors. For example, one of the most renowned and respected in the space is the San Francisco based Coinbase (COIN). Coinbase went public in 2021 and took the world by surprise when its total valuation was $85 billion on their first day. (15). SImilarly to Crypto.com Coinbase, too has its own Visa card, albeit its functionality is not nearly as encompassing as its competitor’s. Coinbase, also does not do borrowing, and lending. Their focus, as a public company, has been to meet guidelines as set forth by the SEC and various entities and stay current on the rapidly changing regulatory environment.
	Another major player in the space is Binance. It is arguably the most known and used platform in the space and also the most criticized. The SEC has an ongoing investigation against the company as they may have broken US securities laws during their ICO in 2017. (16)
	It is easy to see that Crypto.com has given a lot to allow for mass adoption within the space. While it cannot be measured by numbers the continuation of its services allow more and more people to take personal finance in their own hands. 
	Currently the most common  way to measure a crypto company success is through its own market cap. Although this really does not give a good picture as it is nothing else but its token price multiplied by the total number of tokens in circulation. 
	Crypto.com is one of the best performing assets in the space. Although its token price is just as volatile as the whole crypto market, the company does not deviate from its plan based on the token’s price.
